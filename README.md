## Motivation

I wanted a simple script to analyze my monthly expenses to better understand my spending habits.
Using a basic rule engine, the script categorizes transactions into groups such as groceries, living, leisure, etc.
Currently, it generates a bar plot of my expenses per category based on the rules I've defined.

Run the project:

```shell
python src/fat_cats_with_polars/run.py file_in.csv
```
